## Team Contributions

For Project - Phase 1, we were assigned to create an application that will allow users to register and login. When the user registers, the user will be prompted to provide their username, password, first name, last name and email. Once the user has an account, they can login where they must provide their username and password. If login is successful, the user will be redirected to a new welcome page. However, if login is unsuccessful, the user will not be redirected to the welcome page.
